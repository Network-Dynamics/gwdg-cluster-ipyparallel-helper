We show how to setup Ipython parallel in GWDG Clusters. 
Adapted from [ipyparallel docs](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/process.html#using-ipcluster-in-pbs-mode).


To setup, specify a profile name at `setup.sh`:
```bash
PROFILENAME=<chosen name>
``` 

Then run the shell script:
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
